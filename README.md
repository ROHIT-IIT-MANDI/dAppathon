# Aptos Iterable Table Interface

Aptos Iterable Table Interface is a decentralized web application that provides a front-end interface to interact with an **Iterable Table** smart contract on the **Aptos blockchain**. The smart contract implements a double-linked list, enabling easy insertion, deletion, and iteration over table entries. This interface allows users to view, add, and remove entries from the contract and manage on-chain data efficiently.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Easily interact with the Aptos Iterable Table smart contract.
- **Add/Remove Entries**: Users can add new entries or remove existing ones from the table.
- **Table Visualization**: Provides a visual representation of the table structure and allows iteration through entries.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Fetch real-time data from the contract, reflecting changes as they happen.
- **Aptos Blockchain Integration**: Powered by Aptos blockchain, leveraging secure and scalable blockchain technology.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Blockchain**: Aptos blockchain, Move smart contract language
- **Smart Contract**: Move Language

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed
- Aptos CLI set up
- Move language installed
- Access to an Aptos node for testing and deployment

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aptos-iterable-table-interface.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd aptos-iterable-table-interface
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the Aptos environment and deploy the `iterable_table` smart contract using the provided Move module.

## Usage

1. Start the Node.js backend:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. Launch the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open the application in your browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. Interact with the Aptos Iterable Table by adding, removing, or viewing entries.



## Smart Contract (Move Language)

The smart contract is written in the Move language and can be found in the `aptos/` directory. It implements an iterable table using a double-linked list, allowing for efficient traversal and management of key-value pairs.
